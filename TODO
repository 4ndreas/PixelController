TODO PixelController
--------------------
-MatrixData: make internal buffersize configurable (currently deviceSize*8) to reduce cpu load
-Do not freeze application if output fails (disconnect controller)
-Particle generator (rain,snow,fireworks...) remember: maybe rip from cocos2d particle system, should replace fire and metaballs
-More layouts (Half/Half, 3/1...). Current layouts are hardware dependant. New layout shouldn't be. 
   +---+---+---+
   | a | b | c |
   +---+---+---+   
   | d | e | f |
   +---+---+---+   
 Example: 3/1 Layout defines 2 virtual panels, panel 1 using physical panel a,b,d,e panel 2 using physical panel c and f.
 Example: Fancy Layout defines 3 virtual panels, panel 1 using physical panel a,b,d,e, panel 2 using physical panel c
          panel 3 using physical panel f
-Artnet output: support multiple output devices / multiple universe
-Unit Testing is suboptimal, the file config.properties is not used 
-Support Kinect for Xbox 360 
-Support Renard Protocol
-Manual for v1.3


Changelog v1.2 to v1.3
------------------------
-add integrated GUI!
-add Color-Sets, predefined color definition for all generators, effects and mixers
-support more output formats (not only RGB and RBG), thanks to noxx6
-added PixelInvaders SPI firmware, much faster than the bit banging version
-configuration fixes
-update AdaVision driver
-support UDP output device
-support TPM2 serial output devices
-support TPM2 net output devices
-support rainbowduino v3 output devices
-add start scripts for OSX
-add flipX and flipY effects
-Texturedeform is not a generator anymore but an effect
-removed emboss effect, as the result was ugly
-removed Xor and MinusHalf mixer, as the result was ugly
-removed image zoomer generator, as it looks ugly and was a duplicate.
-Integrate OSC Server
-Reduce CPU load
-fixed Blinkenlight video player race condition
-improved rxtx lib, fix some 64bit issus


Changelog v1.1 to v1.2
------------------------
-PixelInvaders Firmware, fixed strip.doSwapBuffersAsap(0)
-Support AdaVision


Changelog v1.0.3 to v1.1
------------------------
-add notification if random mode is selected or not
-more threads! the output gets calculated on the fly, this means wait until the visuals are generated. 
 if they would run in seperate thread, that would be faster...
-decoupling visual generation from output update, should increase performance
-New Generators: ColorScroll, ColorFade and ScreenCapture. Removed Simple Colors
-PixelInvaders firmware: update initial image in firmware
-PixelInvaders firmware: add autonomous firmware mode, run simple animation if no computer is connected
-ScreenCapture: make capturing area visible to user
-create osc tabled gui for Control (OSC + MIDI) (http://charlie-roberts.com/Control)
-manual mapping to support fancy led mapping (OnePanelResolutionAwareOutput class). define a configuration property like 
 output.mapping=1,2,5,6,3,4,7,8 ...
-Log output to a file instead the command line
-artnet output: make first universe id configurable
-possible to start pixelcontroller with a preset
